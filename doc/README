The document of xgboost is generated with recommonmark and sphinx.

You can build it locally by typing "make html" in this folder.
- You will need to rerun the recommonmark script for readthedocs in sphinx_util.
- This was a hack to get the customized parser into readthedocs, hopefully to be removed in future.
