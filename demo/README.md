## Machine Learning Challenge Winning Solutions

"Over the last six months, a new algorithm has come up on Kaggle __winning every single competition__ in this category, it is an algorithm called __XGBoost__." -- Anthony Goldbloom, Founder & CEO of Kaggle (from his presentation "What Is Winning on Kaggle?" [youtube link](https://youtu.be/GTs5ZQ6XwUM?t=7m7s))

XGBoost has helped on these winning solutions:
