\title{Callback closures for booster training.}
\description{
These are used to perform various service tasks either during boosting iterations or at the end.
This approach helps to modularize many of such tasks without bloating the main training methods, 
and it offers .
}
\details{
By default, a callback function is run after each boosting iteration.
An R-attribute \code{is_pre_iteration} could be set for a callback to define a pre-iteration function.

When a callback function has \code{finalize} parameter, its finalizer part will also be run after 
the boosting is completed.

WARNING: side-effects!!! Be aware that these callback functions access and modify things in 
the environment from which they are called from, which is a fairly uncommon thing to do in R.

To write a custom callback closure, make sure you first understand the main concepts about R envoronments.
Check either the R docs on \code{\link[base]{environment}} or the 
\href{http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Environments.html}{Environments chapter} from Hadley Wickham's "Advanced R" book.
Then take a look at the code of \code{cb.reset_learning_rate} for a simple example, 
and see the \code{cb.log_evaluation} code for something more involved.
Also, you would need to get familiar with the objects available inside of the \code{xgb.train} internal environment.
